I tested in Ubuntu and found:
Most programs are working well in Linux.
With the latest update from the login script capslock notification is working now with Linux.
I found a solution for printing listings with Linux see following lines.

Retrieve <printer_name> on Linux terminal:
lpstat -p -d 
set default printer with:
lpoptions -d <printer_name>
set fonts and margins for printing (A4) with:
lpoptions -o page-left=18 -o page-right=0 -o page-top=25 -o page-bottom=80 -o cpi=13 -o lpi=6
Follow these settings exactly for printlists with more pages

The fonts in Linux differ from Windows. (Install Arial, Comic Sans MS and Times)
pgpass.conf must be renamed in .pgpass in Linux and placed in /home/<user>       (<user> = home directory)
startup files in Linux:
place pandora.png from folder LINUX in folder /home/<user>/.icons
place Pandora.desktop from folder LINUX in /home/<user>/.local/share/applications
